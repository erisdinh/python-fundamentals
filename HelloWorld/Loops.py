# Loops
#
# Loops types:
# - While loops
# - Infinite loops
# - While loops
# - Nested loops
#
# WHILE loops
# Syntax:
# while expressions:
#     statements
# OR:
# x = 0
# while x < 10: print(x); x+=1
# Example:
# x = 0
# while x < 10:
#     print(x)
#     x+=1

# INIFINITE loops:
# x = 0
# while x < 10:
#     print(x)

# # ELSE WITH WHILE loops:
# x = 0
# while x < 10:
#     print(x)
#     x+=1
# else:
#     print("x >= 10")

# NESTED WHILE loops:
# Syntax:
# while expression:
#     while expression:
#         statement(s)
#     statement(S)
# Example:
# b = 0;
# while b <= 10:
#     x = 0
#     print(b)
#     while x <= 15:
#         print(x)
#         x+=1
#     b+=1

# FOR loops:
# Syntax:
# for iterating_var in sequence:
#     statments(s)
# Example:
# for letter in 'python':
#     print(letter)

# NESTED FOR loops:
# for i in range (2,20):
#     for x in range(2,i):
#         if i %  x == 0:
#             print(i, "equals", x, " * ", i/x)
#             break
#     else:
#         print(i, " is a prime number")
